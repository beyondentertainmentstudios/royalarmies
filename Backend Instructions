Back End Instructions
Refer to lastknights.com for an idea of how to create the mechanics of this type of web game.
If you have already tried it out, as was requested, to better understand the scope of this project then please read on.
I will be speaking to you all directly on exactly how I want the game to react to the players and the causes and effects of gameplay.
The overall structure of the game should work in favor of the players.
We need to ensure that our game is readable, comprehensible, and user-friendly.
We must help our players recieve the most out of this game without having them fall victim to confusion and boredom.
Players like a challenge but not when it makes little sense.
Everything from registering for the first time to letting the battle simulator work its magic in training and/or larger battles needs to be aim toward perfection.
Refer to my layout designs as guidelines only.
If you discover better ways to help our players enjoy the game more or just have an opinion about something do not hesitate to tell me.

Below is the TASK LIST and will be the same for both Front and Backend programmers but, ofcourse, involving different jobs.
Once we are completed with one task and we have confirmed that it is working effectively all programmers will be permitted to continue to the next task.
The tasks may change based on what needs to be done so pay close attention to the task list.
Thanks again for all of your help!
